**ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) Feature Extraction Model**

Overview:

ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is a feature extraction model used in computer vision for detecting and describing keypoints or interest points in images. 
It combines two key algorithms, FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features), to achieve efficient and robust feature extraction.



**Key Algorithms:**

FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test):

FAST is a corner detection algorithm used for rapid feature detection in images.
It works by comparing the intensity of pixels around a central pixel in a circular pattern. If a sufficient number of pixels in the pattern are brighter or darker than the central pixel, it is considered a corner.
FAST is highly efficient and is capable of detecting keypoints in real-time applications.
BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features):

BRIEF is a feature descriptor algorithm used for encoding local image patches around keypoints.
It generates binary strings as descriptors by comparing the intensity of pixel pairs within a small image patch.
BRIEF descriptors are compact and efficient, making them suitable for memory-constrained environments and fast matching operations.
